Public Ledger: Transparent and auditable records for municipal and community verification.

🟢 EcoToken Rewards

Incentivized Recycling: Earn ERC-20 EcoTokens for verified waste submissions.

Utility & Redemption: Use tokens for local discounts, eco-initiatives, or donations.

Polygon Network: Fast, low-cost transactions with Ethereum Layer 2 integration.

🟢 Waste Analytics Dashboard

Real-Time Visualization: Dynamic heatmaps displaying waste generation patterns.

AI Route Optimization: Intelligent algorithms for optimizing collection truck routes.

Predictive Insights: Forecasting tools to identify future waste hotspots and streamline resource allocation.

🟢 Community Tools

Illegal Dumping Reports: Crowdsourced reporting and monitoring of waste violations.

Community Clean-Up: Support for organizing and promoting environmental clean-up drives.

Educational Resources: Access to information on sustainable waste management practices.
